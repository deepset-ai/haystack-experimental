- [ ] Add experiment to pydocs
- [ ] Add experiment to catalog in haystack-experimental README.md
- [ ] Make sure a new version of haystack experimental is released within one week
- [ ] Open a new discussion in https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack-experimental/discussions and pin it
- [ ] Draft a social media post content for that feature 
- [ ] Include announcement of the experiment in weekly Haystack updates
